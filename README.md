# Responsive Chrome Extension Detection

This is a jQuery plugin to detect chrome extensions by their key value and serve custom content 

Initially the goal is to detect the buffer chrome extension and simply serve content on successful detection:

<code><div>BUFFER!</div></code> 

The main script for this was taken from http://blog.kotowicz.net/2012/02/intro-to-chrome-addons-hacking.html
